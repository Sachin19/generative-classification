      "[\"it 's a charming and often affecting journey . \", 'unflinchingly bleak and desperate ', 'allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . ', \"the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production 's austere locales . \", \"it 's slow -- very , very slow . \", 'although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . ', 'a sometimes tedious film . ', \"or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife . \", \"you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . \", \"in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . \", 'the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . ', 'it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . ', '... the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) ... ', \"we root for ( clara and paul ) , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity . \", \"even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . \", 'a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . ', \"the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma . \", \"audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie . \", '... the movie is just a plain old monster . ', 'in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . ', 'pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . ', 'the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . ', 'holden caulfield did it better . ', 'a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . ', 'seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . ', \"nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . \", 'the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . ', \"it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . \", \"it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . \", 'i had to look away - this was god awful . ', \"thanks to scott 's charismatic roger and eisenberg 's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . \", \"... designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . \", 'a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . ', \"if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . \", \"it does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored . \", \"a sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes . \", 'the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . ', \"( w ) hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall 's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . \", 'as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . ', 'escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . ', \"there 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . \", 'this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . ', \"the subtle strength of `` elling '' is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . \", 'holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . ', 'the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . ', 'it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . ', 'a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . ', 'a subtle and well-crafted ( for the most part ) chiller . ', 'has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . ', \"it 's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . \", 'it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . ', \"for the most part , director anne-sophie birot 's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . \", 'mr. tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? ', 'sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . ', 'so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises ', 'a tender , heartfelt family drama . ', '... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . ', \"the cold turkey would 've been a far better title . \", 'manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . ', \"it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . \", \"this is a story of two misfits who do n't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . \", 'schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . ', 'the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . ', 'on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . ', \"the script kicks in , and mr. hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . \", \"you wonder why enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . \", \"if you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . \", 'a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . ', 'good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! ', 'this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . ', 'for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . ', 'exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . ', 'uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . ', 'one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . ', 'a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . ', \"among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation . \", 'the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . ', \"the son 's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . \", 'there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .
